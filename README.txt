Hello, 
    Welcome to my program. This program will run the N-Queens problem in c++. 
    Below are the commands that you can use to run my program. d

        make run:
        input this command into the terminal to execute the program. 

        make clean:
        input this command into the terminal to remove the old version of the program.

    When the user boots up my program for the first time in the terminal just putting in 'make run'
    will get the user exactly what they need in the program. After using the program, the user needs to 
    just run the 'make clean' command to delete the old version of the program and get it ready to start over.
